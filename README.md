# MyFinanceLogger
Small little JavaFX Application, to log your personal finances.

This small desktop app will be able to help track expenses, by dividing them into categories and displaying a couple of charts to show the balance of income vs expenses and how much money is spent on different categories.
It is an exercise to build a JavaFX Application from start to finish.

Currently Working:
  - Input of Expenses
  - Displaying Expenses and Income, numerically as well as graphically in a pie chart
  - Saving the data - the App remembers income an expenses after closing and will start again with those values
 
Goals:
  - Create Categories (to accomplish this, build Expense Class, to store information such as Time, Category, Amount)
  - Save Expenses in an encrypted format, so data can only be read by the application
  - Add Screen for Expense input (with Category chooser)
  - Add Screen for an Expense "Timeline"
  - Add Screen for graphical representations of Spendings, divided by category 
  [- Add possibilty to render monthly reports to JPG/PDF/...]
  [- Add support for multiple accounts, including transfers between accounts]
